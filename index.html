            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate of the Fullstack Engineering Path bootcamp at Thinkful.
What i love most about being a web developer is that it satisfies my need for structure and organization while simultaniously allowing me to be free and 
creative. It scratches both itches. Being originally from the San Francisco
Bay Area, I have seen first hand how tech can quickly and decisvely change the world. I love solving problems, and truly get excited learning new frameworks and discovering nw ways to do things.
Aside from coding, I enjoy learning languages and am an aspiring polyglot. I guess you can say I love communicating 
in as many ways as possible, be it with people or computers.
